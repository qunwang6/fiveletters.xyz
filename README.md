## Rules of the game

The best way to learn the game is to <a href="https://fiveletters.xyz">play it</a>, as it contains an unobtrusive interactive tutorial.

The objective of the game is to guess the hidden five-letter word.
You have five tries to guess the word by typing in an English five-letter word.

For each guess, you will which of the letters that you entered are:
- not in the solution word at all
- in the solution word, but in a different position
- in the solution word, and in the same position

Each letter that you have entered that is not in the solution word will no longer be available for further guesses.

If you manage to guess the correct word within five tries, you win!
